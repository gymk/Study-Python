# 1. Analyzing Data Using Simulations and Resampling

Theme: Resampling Statistics

Big Idea: Statistics modeled in a program are easier to get right and understand than using a formulaic approach. It is also extends to more complicated simulations that classic formulas.

```text
Examples
========

* Six roulette wheel spins
  \-> choices with weighting

* Deal 20 playing cards without replacement (16 tens, 36 low)
 \-> Counter, elements, sample, list.count

* 5 or more heads from 7 spins of a biased coin
 \-> lambda, choices, list.count

* Probability that the median of 5 samples falls a middle quartile
 \-> chained comparison, choices from a range

* Bootstrapping to estimate the confidence internal on a sample of data
 \-> sorted, mean, choices

* Statistical significance of the difference of two means
 \-> shuffle slicing mean

* Single server queue simulation
 \-> expovariate gauss mean median stdev conditional-expressions
